                Maze Game ReadMe:
                Purpose - make it to the end of the Maze!
                
                Up=W 
                Down=S
                Left=A
                Right=D
                
                To play the game use the arrow keys and navigate through the maze.
                Players can also select the difficulty of the maze by pressing the "harder"
                and "easier" buttons to access all 5 levels.
                
                Issues: This is the game that is still in progress, while my code for switching levels 
                and creating the mazes works, I am still figuring out the code to move through the maze.
