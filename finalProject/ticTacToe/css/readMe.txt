Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Purpose: To get three x marks in a row before the computer gets three o's.

Players click in the box they want to mark to start the game and then continue to 
click where they want to play throughout the game. The Computer generates the o
player's turn automatically. Once the game ends (in a win, tie, or loss), 
the player can press play again to replay tic-tac-toe.

Issues:
There is currently no code that prevents the player from clicking on an 
already marked box, so playeres could easily cheat, defeating the purpose of
the game.
