    The audience for this website would be pretty wide 
    but would tend to be older users and not super young children. 
    This is because the games are themed to be like mind/brain games
    so young kids would not be that intrested.

    I choose a flexbox layout where each game has it's own section.
    Within those sections users can directly choose to play the game or
    they can see the description and then play the game. 
    I choose to layout the page like this so that users could have quick acces
    to the games and at the same time have a clear way to learn more if they
    are confused.

    My color scheme is really simple, the main colors are tan and dark
    blue, which I got fro the background image. I also used some white to help
    define certian sections of the page. The logo for the meory game is more 
    colorful than the rest of the page simply so that users will be able to better
    recognize what that game is. I used such a simple color scheme so that the page 
    would look professional and somewhat educational because of my mind games 
    theme and I felt that I did not need to use espically bright colors because 
    the page's audience is mainly not kids.
